# Digit Recognizer using PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to achieve over 99% accuracy on the test set.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Dataset instructions.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration.
- `src/`: Core scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `outputs/`: Results such as submission files and saved models.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koyunkyung/digit_recognizer.git
   cd digit_recognizer
